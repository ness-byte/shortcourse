<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About the project

<!-- [![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com) -->

This is a combination of Gil's original extension tool and Alana's amazing search tool. With recent changes to icons, code snippets, and the Azure CDN, it was time to revisit this tool and bring it into 2025!

This tool will contain the following:
* Code snippets for design elements within the ACUO design library
* Icon code snippets
* (New!) Search functionality
* (New!) Customise your buttons
* Alt text visibility toggle
* Compatibility with Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Brave, and Mozilla Firefox

Please note that this is a streamlined version of the original tool, with some of the older features removed. Use [request feature][request-feature] to request a new feature, or [report bug][report-bug] if there's something wrong with the tool.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting started

1. Download the [latest version][download-url] of the tool and unzip it, making sure to remove previous old versions if you have any. Inside the unzipped folder will be a folder called `snippy-main`.
2. Go to the Chrome Extensions page by clicking the three dots (top right) in Chrome, then <b>More tools</b>, then <b>Extensions</b>.
3. Make sure <b>Developer mode</b> is activated using the toggle in the top right.
4. Remove the old version of the ACUO design library extension by clicking the <b>Remove</b> button.
5. To load the new extension, click the <b>Load unpacked</b> button and navigate to the `snippy-main` folder you unzipped earlier.
6. Finally, head over to your extensions (the little puzzle piece) and then pin the ACUO design library extension wizard to your toolbar. Now it's easily accessible when you need it.

<h3>Hot tip #1: Refresh!</h3>
Use the <b>Refresh files</b> button every now and then to ensure you have the latest version of code snippets.

<h3>Hot tip #2: Add a hotkey for the extension</h3>
On your extensions page, click the burger menu on the left, then click <b>Keyboard shortcuts</b>. Choose whatever hotkey you like (e.g. ctrl-D), then click <b>Update</b>.

<h3>Hot tip #3: Alt text visibility</h3>
Refresh the page after ticking the checkbox to activate alt text visibility.
