<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting started

<h3>Chrome and Edge</h3>

1. Download the [latest version][download-url] of the tool and unzip it, making sure to remove previous old versions if you have any. Inside the unzipped folder will be a folder called `shortcourse-main`.
2. Go to the Extensions page by clicking the three dots (top right) in the browser, then <b>More tools</b>, then <b>Extensions</b>.
3. Make sure <b>Developer mode</b> is activated using the toggle in the top right.
4. If an older version of the extension is installed, remove it by clicking the <b>Remove</b> button.
5. To load the new extension, click the <b>Load unpacked</b> button and navigate to the `shortcourse-main` folder you unzipped earlier.
6. Finally, head over to your extensions (the little puzzle icon) and then pin the ACU Short Course design library extension wizard to your toolbar. Now it's easily accessible when you need it.

<h3>Firefox</h3>

1. Download the latest .zip file from our SharePoint. There is no need to unzip it.
2. Go to the <b>Extensions</b> page by clicking the puzzle icon in the toolbar and then selecting 'Extensions' from the left menu.
3. In <b>Manage Your Extensions</b>, click on the settings icon and select 'Install Add-on From File...'
4. Navigate to the .zip file you downloaded in step 1 and click <b>Open</b>.
5. Right-click on the wizard icon in the toolbar to pin the extension to the toolbar.

<h3>Hot tip #1: Use ctrl-/ to comment/uncomment!</h3>
Where snippets have multiple options (e.g. different aspect ratios for images), these have been included in the snippet code but commented out. Use the keyboard shortcut <b>ctrl-/</b> to select the one you need, and delete the rest to keep your code clean.

<h3>Hot tip #2: Refresh!</h3>
Use the <b>Refresh files</b> button every now and then to ensure you have the latest version of code snippets (but don't hit this button more than once an hour).

<h3>Hot tip #3: Add a hotkey for the extension</h3>
On your extensions page, click the burger menu on the left, then click <b>Keyboard shortcuts</b>. Choose whatever hotkey you like (e.g. ctrl-D), then click <b>Update</b>.

<h3>Hot tip #4: Alt text visibility</h3>
Refresh the page after ticking the checkbox to activate alt text visibility.

<h3>Hot tip #5: Failed to initialise extension</h3>
If you get a 'failed to initialise extension' error, wait a little while before trying again.
